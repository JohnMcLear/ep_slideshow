# HOW TO USE (tm)
* Ensure ep_headings2 plugin is installed
* Apply Heading 1 to each part of a pad you want to represent a new slide
* Click Settings -> Slideshow
* Navigate through your documents as a slideshow using left/right click, left/right arrows and swipe motions / gestures
* Use ?slideshow=true in the URL to automatically enable the slideshow view - no longer works due to browser restrictions.

# TODO
* Support different backgrounds and layout

# WHY
I made this for a presentation I'm giving on Etherpad and because it's nice to think waffles can boogie.
