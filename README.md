# ep_slideshow

Use headings to create slideshows..

# HOW TO USE (tm)
* Apply Heading 1 to each part of a pad you want to represent a new slide
* Click Settings -> Slideshow
* Navigate through your documents as a slideshow using left/right click and left/right arrows
* Use ?slideshow=true in the URL to automatically enable the slideshow view

# TODO
* Go backwards without right click IE if you have a tablet.  Perhaps support clicking on a certain part of the page..
* Support different backgrounds and layout

# WHY
I made this for a presentation I'm giving on Etherpad
